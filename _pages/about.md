My passion is guiding and supporting clients in optimizing technical solutions, including SaaS products.

Throughout my career, I have held positions related to customer success and account retention. I have managed complex relations that require the ability to deliver ROI-driven solutions. Clients have recognized me as a strategic thinker who tracks data to anticipate clients’ needs and offer proactive, collaborative service. My duties have included all aspects of post-sales support and customer service, including implementation, on-boarding, and training clients’ staff.

In all of my client interactions, I am proactive in reviewing reports to offer data-driven, consultative solutions. Working for a startup that sold a SaaS product, I developed the ability to adapt quickly to changes in product features and functionality. I am certified in marketing tools (Google Analytics, Google AdWords) and have used technology that ranges from the leading CRM (Salesforce) to basic coding skills in Python, SQL, and HTML. This background has given me the ability to understand both technical and business requirement across a wide range of industries.

Outside of work, I am an avid triathlete and love to watch San Antonio Spurs, Tottenham Hotspur and Houston Astros games. I have a wife, Carly, and a daughter Peyton.
